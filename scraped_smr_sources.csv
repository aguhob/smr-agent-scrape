Authorities arrested over 100 suspected undocumented immigrants in a federal raid on a Colorado nightclub that saw guns and drugs including methamphetamine and pink cocaine seized early Sunday, officials said.
The big picture: President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the raid on the Colorado Springs club, some 70 miles south of Denver, as the administration faces criticism over the arrest of a judge in an immigration case and U.S. citizen children being sent to Honduras with their deported mothers.

CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" Sunday show ended by taking aim at parent company Paramount over former executive producer Bill Owens' departure last week.
The big picture: CBS' Scott Pelley said in the segment that Paramount ""is trying to complete a merger"" the Trump administration ""must approve"" and it ""began to supervise our content in new ways,"" adding: ""None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.""

Former National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins said in an interview broadcast Sunday he retired last month because his position became ""untenable"" under the second Trump administration's actions.
Why it matters: The noted geneticist's departure occurred after DOGE-driven cuts were announced for research funding and probationary workers' contracts were terminated, and Collins told CBS News that he and other scientists were ""not allowed to speak — in any kind of scientific meeting or public setting.""

Fight climate change.
Eliminate air pollution.
Cure the planet.
As doctors, we understand the need to fight climate change and eliminate air pollution while maintaining the power we need to operate hospitals 24/7/365.
Nuclear energy provides the reliable, low-carbon power we need to efficiently decarbonize. Around the world, nuclear energy has sustainably displaced fossil fuels, whose pollution takes more than 5,000,000 lives every year.

(NASDAQ: NNE) is an advanced technology-driven nuclear energy company seeking to become a commercially focused, diversified, and vertically integrated company across five business lines: (i) cutting edge portable and other microreactor technologies, (ii) nuclear fuel fabrication, (iii) nuclear fuel transportation, (iv) nuclear applications for space and (v) nuclear industry consulting services. NANO Nuclear believes it is the first portable nuclear microreactor company to be listed publicly in the U.S.
Led by a world-class nuclear engineering team, NANO Nuclear’s reactor products in development include patented KRONOS MMR™ Energy System, a stationary high-temperature gas-cooled reactor that is in construction permit pre-application engagement U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in collaboration with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), “ZEUS”, a solid core battery reactor, and “ODIN”, a low-pressure coolant reactor, and the space focused, portable LOKI MMR™, each representing advanced developments in clean energy solutions that are portable, on-demand capable, advanced nuclear microreactors.
Advanced Fuel Transportation Inc. (AFT), a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is led by former executives from the largest transportation company in the world aiming to build a North American transportation company that will provide commercial quantities of HALEU fuel to small modular reactors, microreactor companies, national laboratories, military, and DOE programs. Through NANO Nuclear, AFT is the exclusive licensee of a patented high-capacity HALEU fuel transportation basket developed by three major U.S. national nuclear laboratories and funded by the Department of Energy. Assuming development and commercialization, AFT is expected to form part of the only vertically integrated nuclear fuel business of its kind in North America.
HALEU Energy Fuel Inc. (HEF), a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is focusing on the future development of a domestic source for a High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel fabrication pipeline for NANO Nuclear’s own microreactors as well as the broader advanced nuclear reactor industry.
NANO Nuclear Space Inc. (NNS), a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is exploring the potential commercial applications of NANO Nuclear’s developing micronuclear reactor technology in space. NNS is focusing on applications such as the LOKI MMR™ system and other power systems for extraterrestrial projects and human sustaining environments, and potentially propulsion technology for long haul space missions. NNS’ initial focus will be on cis-lunar applications, referring to uses in the space region extending from Earth to the area surrounding the Moon’s surface.

Our first Natrium plant is currently being built in Wyoming.
The properties of this material enable the system to operate at low pressure and cool naturally - making it simpler and safer than any of today's plants.
Our innovative molten salt energy storage fills this energy gap, delivering stable electricity supply for the grid when renewables are offline. Other designs do not have this flexibility.
By moving to a much simpler plant design, the Natrium technology requires far fewer resources to construct and operate. This results in lower costs and higher value.
