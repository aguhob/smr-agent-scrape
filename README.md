Citizen NS' “Race2Build”. team won 2nd place at the Climate x AI hackathon held during SF Climate Week! 

Amazing to work with Grant Draper’s brilliant ideas. Kavya Kowtha & Shivangi Narayan huge thanks for stellar design and AI support!

We built a Climate Project Success Tool powered by agentic AI—streamlining months of stakeholder feedback into minutes. It’s designed for major climate builds like nuclear SMRs and opens decision-making to investors, developers, and community voices alike.

Our tool provides a space for everyone to share their perspectives, providing an inclusive discussion on significant community initiatives. Great to see tremendous interest at the event!
